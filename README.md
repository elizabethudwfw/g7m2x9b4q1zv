<h2>🚨 Why You’re HWID Banned Across All Games</h2>

<p>To bypass a ban, you first need to understand it. Unlike simple account bans, a HWID ban targets your computer’s unique hardware identifiers — a digital fingerprint composed of serial numbers, MAC addresses, BIOS UUIDs, and more. Most modern anti-cheat engines detect and blacklist these IDs, preventing any new accounts created on your device from playing.</p>

<p>This means reinstalling your game or changing your IP address doesn’t work — the ban is linked directly to your hardware. Leading anti-cheat systems now inspect deeply into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Motherboard and BIOS serials and UUIDs</li>
  <li>Hard drive and SSD volume serial numbers</li>
  <li>Network adapter MAC addresses</li>
  <li>GPU device IDs and peripheral hardware keys</li>
</ul>

<p>Once blacklisted, your PC is effectively blocked from accessing the game, regardless of how many accounts you make.</p>

<h2>⚙️ What BypassX Does to Bypass HWID Bans</h2>

<p>BypassX completely changes your system’s hardware and software footprint by spoofing all critical IDs that modern anti-cheat systems reference. It performs an all-encompassing identity overhaul—from motherboard serials to network hardware and even software traces associated with bans.</p>

<p>Here’s what BypassX covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Motherboard & BIOS Spoofing:</strong> Generates randomized SMBIOS data and system UUIDs, making your device appear brand new.</li>
  <li><strong>Drive Serial Spoofing:</strong> Alters volume serial numbers of all drives to mask previous game installations and ban records.</li>
  <li><strong>MAC Address Spoofing:</strong> Changes MAC addresses on all active network cards, including VPN virtual adapters.</li>
  <li><strong>GPU & Peripheral ID Spoofing:</strong> Edits registry keys for GPUs and peripherals to avoid detection.</li>
  <li><strong>System Cleaner:</strong> Deletes event logs, DNS caches, crash dumps, temporary files, and recent document histories to wipe software traces.</li>
  <li><strong>Account Unlinking:</strong> Disconnects linked gaming accounts like Xbox Live and Discord that anti-cheat systems may track.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, BypassX crafts a clean machine profile that anti-cheat engines can’t associate with your prior ban, enabling access with new accounts.</p>

<h3>Advanced Spoofing Options (For Severe Bans)</h3>

<p>For highly aggressive HWID bans—like those from Riot’s Vanguard or BattlEye—BypassX offers advanced features such as EFI firmware variable spoofing, TPM key replacement, CPU and GPU device ID alterations, and disabling Windows security components that hinder spoofing.</p>

<p>These options dramatically improve bypass rates in tough environments but carry elevated risks and are recommended only for experienced users. Always create a system restore point before applying advanced tweaks.</p>

<h2>💻 Technical Insights: How BypassX Spoofs HWID Under the Hood</h2>

<p>If you want to understand how BypassX modifies your PC’s hardware identity to survive ban enforcement, here’s a deeper dive into the methods and example scripts powering spoofing at multiple system layers.</p>

<h3>1. Registry Spoofing: Altering Hardware Identifiers</h3>

<p>Critical hardware components store unique IDs in the Windows registry. Anti-cheat systems scan these for fingerprinting. BypassX automates the modification of these keys to mask your device.</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell script example to spoof GPU DeviceID in registry

$regPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1E07&SUBSYS_85AE1043&REV_A1\4&2d9c3f5&0&0008"
$valueName = "DeviceID"

# Generate randomized DeviceID string
$newDeviceID = "DEV_" + (Get-Random -Minimum 1000 -Maximum 9999)

# Set new DeviceID value
Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $newDeviceID

Write-Host "GPU DeviceID spoofed to $newDeviceID"
</code></pre>

<p>This snippet targets the GPU’s DeviceID key. BypassX runs similar routines across motherboard UUIDs, drive serials, and other hardware registry keys.</p>

<h3>2. MAC Address Spoofing: Reassigning Network IDs</h3>

<p>Network adapters have fixed MAC addresses unique to your PC. Spoofing involves assigning new randomized MAC addresses to obscure hardware identity.</p>

<pre><code>
@echo off
REM Batch snippet to generate random locally administered MAC prefix

setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set mac=
for /l %%i in (1,1,6) do (
  set /a randNum=!random! %% 256
  set hex=00
  for %%x in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) do (
    if !randNum! equ %%x set hex=%%x
  )
  if %%i equ 1 (
    REM Set locally administered bit
    set /a randNum=(randNum | 2)
  )
  set /a hi=randNum / 16
  set /a lo=randNum %% 16
  set /a hi=!hi!
  set /a lo=!lo!
  for %%h in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) do (
    if !hi! equ %%h set hiHex=%%h
    if !lo! equ %%h set loHex=%%h
  )
  set mac=!mac!!hiHex!!loHex!
  if %%i lss 6 set mac=!mac!-
)
echo New randomized MAC: %mac%

REM Applying new MAC requires registry or driver update steps - snippet only shows generation
</code></pre>

<p>BypassX handles the complex application of these addresses to network drivers, ensuring persistence after reboot.</p>

<h3>3. System Restore Point: Safety First</h3>

<p>Spoofing alters system-critical settings, so creating a Windows restore point beforehand is vital:</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell to create a system restore point
Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before BypassX Spoofing" -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"
Write-Host "System restore point created successfully."
</code></pre>

<p>This lets you revert back if anything unexpected occurs.</p>

<h3>4. Cleaning Logs and Temporary Files</h3>

<p>Anti-cheat software scans cached event logs, DNS records, crash dumps, and temporary files for traces of banned activity. BypassX automates clearing these with scripts similar to:</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell snippet to clear Windows event logs and flush DNS

# Flush DNS cache
ipconfig /flushdns

# Clear Application event log
wevtutil cl Application

# Clear System event log
wevtutil cl System

# Clear Security event log (requires admin)
wevtutil cl Security

Write-Host "System logs and DNS cache cleared."
</code></pre>

<h3>5. Automating the Full Spoofing Workflow</h3>

<p>BypassX bundles registry spoofing, MAC randomization, cleaning routines, and more into an easy-to-navigate batch and PowerShell driven interface. Here’s a conceptual automation outline:</p>

<pre><code>
# Pseudo-code outline for BypassX spoofing

function Run-Spoof {
  Write-Host "Creating system restore point..."
  Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before Spoof" -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"

  Write-Host "Cleaning logs and caches..."
  Invoke-Command { Clear-EventLogs; Flush-DNS }

  Write-Host "Spoofing hardware identifiers..."
  Invoke-Command { Spoof-RegistryKeys; Spoof-MACAddresses; Spoof-DriveSerials }

  Write-Host "Restarting system to apply spoofing..."
  Restart-Computer
}

Run-Spoof
</code></pre>

<p>This multi-layered approach ensures every trace of your original hardware ID is replaced and the system reboot applies the new values effectively.</p>

<h3>Why Multi-Layer Spoofing Is Essential</h3>

<p>Modern anti-cheat solutions analyze several factors simultaneously — hardware, software, network, and telemetry data. Simply changing one item (like MAC address) isn’t enough to evade detection. BypassX’s comprehensive spoofing minimizes risk by replacing all key identifiers at once.</p>

<p>Using partial spoofing leaves vulnerabilities that anti-cheat can easily exploit to re-link your ban.</p>
