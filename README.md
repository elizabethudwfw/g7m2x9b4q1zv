<h2>🚨 Why You’re HWID Banned in Arma 3</h2>

<p>Understanding your ban is key. Unlike account bans, an HWID ban targets your machine’s unique hardware identifiers — a digital fingerprint made up of serial numbers, MAC addresses, BIOS UUIDs, and more. Arma 3’s anti-cheat system, BattlEye, flags these identifiers and blocks any new account created on your PC from playing on official servers.</p>

<p>This means VPNs or reinstalling Windows alone won’t help — the ban isn’t tied to your account or IP, but to the hardware itself. BattlEye now scans deeply into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Motherboard and BIOS identifiers (SMBIOS, system UUIDs)</li>
  <li>Storage devices’ serial numbers and volume IDs</li>
  <li>Network adapter MAC addresses</li>
  <li>GPU registry keys and device IDs</li>
</ul>

<p>Once flagged, the game treats your PC as “banned,” no matter how many new accounts you create.</p>

<h2>⚙️ What TraceX Does to Bypass HWID Bans</h2>

<p>TraceX changes your PC’s “identity” by spoofing every major hardware and software identifier that BattlEye tracks. It’s a complete system fingerprint overhaul — from motherboard serials to network hardware and even software traces that anti-cheat programs use to link you to past bans.</p>

<p>Here’s what TraceX covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Motherboard & BIOS Spoofing:</strong> Randomizes SMBIOS data including system and product UUIDs, making your PC appear brand new.</li>
  <li><strong>Drive Serial Number Spoofing:</strong> Changes volume serials on your system and data drives to hide previous game installs.</li>
  <li><strong>MAC Address Spoofing:</strong> Alters MAC addresses on all active network adapters, including VPN virtual adapters.</li>
  <li><strong>GPU & Peripheral Device IDs:</strong> Modifies registry keys related to your GPU and connected peripherals.</li>
  <li><strong>System Log and Crash Dump Cleaning:</strong> Removes Windows event logs, recent document histories, DNS caches, and temporary files to erase software traces.</li>
  <li><strong>Xbox & Discord Account Unlinking:</strong> Disconnects linked gaming accounts that anti-cheat systems might associate with your banned profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, TraceX creates a fresh, clean machine identity that BattlEye can’t recognize as banned, allowing you to play again with a new account.</p>

<h3>Advanced Spoofing Features (For Tough Bans)</h3>

<p>For particularly stubborn or highly aggressive bans—like Valorant’s Vanguard—TraceX offers optional advanced features. These include spoofing firmware EFI variables, CPU and GPU device IDs, Trusted Platform Module (TPM) keys, and disabling certain Windows security features that interfere with spoofing.</p>

<p>While these advanced options can increase your chance of success in extremely strict environments, they carry some risk and are recommended only for experienced users. Always create a system restore point before experimenting.</p>

<p>⚠️ <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Never log into your old banned account or linked Xbox/Discord profiles after spoofing — this will re-associate your new identity with the ban.</p>

<h2>🧠 Why Proper Cleaning and VPN Usage Matter</h2>

<p>Many players mistakenly think spoofing hardware IDs alone is enough, but anti-cheat systems collect extensive software and network traces. TraceX’s integrated cleaner handles these by flushing DNS caches, clearing event logs, wiping browser data, and unlinking linked social gaming accounts that could re-link you to a banned profile.</p>

<p>VPN usage is equally important. It changes your external IP and introduces a new virtual network adapter, providing a fresh network “footprint.” TraceX’s automation for NordVPN setup makes this step painless and optimized for gaming performance.</p>

<h2>🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

<p>While TraceX is designed to be as smooth as possible, some users run into hiccups. Here are common issues and fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“Script Execution Disabled” Errors:</strong> This means PowerShell scripts are blocked by Windows. Enable scripts by running <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass</code> as Administrator in PowerShell.</li>
  <li><strong>“Access Denied” When Running TraceX:</strong> Always run the tool as Administrator and unblock the files in Properties if Windows flags them.</li>
  <li><strong>MAC Address Spoof Reverts on Reboot:</strong> Some network drivers reset MACs. Run TraceX spoof again or use the network reset option in the cleaner.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor Issues After EDID Spoofing:</strong> Uninstall the monitor driver from Device Manager and reboot to restore defaults if your display acts strangely.</li>
  <li><strong>VPN Won’t Connect:</strong> Check your NordVPN credentials or try manual connection with IPVanish as an alternative.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💻 Technical Insights: How Spoofing Works Under the Hood</h2>

<p>If you’re curious about how TraceX actually changes your PC’s hardware identity to bypass bans, here’s a deeper dive into the core techniques and example scripts used behind the scenes. These snippets showcase how spoofing targets hardware fingerprints at multiple levels.</p>

<h3>1. Registry Spoofing: Modifying Hardware Identifiers</h3>

<p>Many hardware components store unique IDs in Windows registry keys. Anti-cheat systems like BattlEye scan these to fingerprint your machine. Changing these values is essential for spoofing.</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell script to spoof a GPU DeviceID in the registry

$regPath = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_1E07&SUBSYS_85AE1043&REV_A1\4&2d9c3f5&0&0008"
$valueName = "DeviceID"

# Generate a randomized DeviceID string
$newDeviceID = "DEV_" + (Get-Random -Minimum 1000 -Maximum 9999)

# Set the new DeviceID in the registry
Set-ItemProperty -Path $regPath -Name $valueName -Value $newDeviceID

Write-Host "GPU DeviceID spoofed to $newDeviceID"
</code></pre>

<p>This example targets the GPU’s DeviceID registry key. TraceX automates similar changes for many hardware keys like motherboard UUIDs, drive serials, and more.</p>

<h3>2. MAC Address Spoofing: Changing Network Adapter IDs</h3>

<p>Network adapters have fixed MAC addresses that uniquely identify your PC on networks. Spoofing involves assigning new randomized MAC addresses to prevent tracking.</p>

<pre><code>
@echo off
REM Batch script snippet to generate a random MAC address prefix (locally administered)

setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
set mac=
for /l %%i in (1,1,6) do (
  set /a randNum=!random! %% 256
  set hex=00
  for %%x in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) do (
    if !randNum! equ %%x set hex=%%x
  )
  if %%i equ 1 (
    REM Locally administered MAC must have the second least significant bit set
    set /a randNum=(randNum | 2)
  )
  set /a hi=randNum / 16
  set /a lo=randNum %% 16
  set /a hi=!hi!
  set /a lo=!lo!
  for %%h in (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F) do (
    if !hi! equ %%h set hiHex=%%h
    if !lo! equ %%h set loHex=%%h
  )
  set mac=!mac!!hiHex!!loHex!
  if %%i lss 6 set mac=!mac!-
)
echo New random MAC: %mac%

REM Actual MAC change requires editing registry or device manager - this is just generation logic
</code></pre>

<p>TraceX handles the complex part of applying these changes to network drivers, ensuring the new MAC sticks after reboot.</p>

<h3>3. System Restore Point: Safety First</h3>

<p>Because spoofing modifies sensitive system settings, creating a Windows restore point before starting is crucial:</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell command to create a system restore point
Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before TraceX Spoofing" -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"
Write-Host "System restore point created successfully."
</code></pre>

<p>This lets you roll back to a safe state if something unexpected happens.</p>

<h3>4. Cleaning System Logs and Temporary Files</h3>

<p>Anti-cheat systems also look at cached logs, DNS history, crash dumps, and temp files to track banned users. TraceX automates cleaning these traces with scripts similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>
# PowerShell snippet to clear Windows event logs and DNS cache

# Clear DNS cache
ipconfig /flushdns

# Clear Application event log
wevtutil cl Application

# Clear System event log
wevtutil cl System

# Clear Security event log (requires elevated privileges)
wevtutil cl Security

Write-Host "System logs and DNS cache cleared."
</code></pre>

<h3>5. Automating the Full Spoofing Workflow</h3>

<p>TraceX bundles all these steps — registry spoofing, MAC randomization, log cleaning, and more — into an easy-to-use, menu-driven batch and PowerShell script. Here's a simplified conceptual snippet of the automation:</p>

<pre><code>
# Pseudo-code outline for TraceX spoofing workflow

function Run-Spoof {
  Write-Host "Creating system restore point..."
  Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before Spoof" -RestorePointType "MODIFY_SETTINGS"

  Write-Host "Cleaning system logs..."
  Invoke-Command { Clear-EventLogs; Flush-DNS }

  Write-Host "Spoofing hardware IDs..."
  Invoke-Command { Spoof-RegistryKeys; Spoof-MACAddresses; Spoof-DriveSerials }

  Write-Host "Restarting system to apply changes..."
  Restart-Computer
}

Run-Spoof
</code></pre>

<p>This layered approach ensures all traces of your old hardware identity are replaced, and the system is reset to apply the new spoofed values.</p>

<h3>Why Multi-Layer Spoofing Matters</h3>

<p>Modern anti-cheat systems don’t rely on a single identifier. They combine hardware fingerprints, software logs, network data, and even behavioral telemetry. TraceX’s effectiveness comes from spoofing multiple components at once — ensuring no single data point reveals your banned hardware.</p>

<p>If only one identifier were changed (e.g., MAC address only), the anti-cheat could easily flag your system using other hardware details. TraceX’s comprehensive spoofing reduces this risk dramatically.</p>
